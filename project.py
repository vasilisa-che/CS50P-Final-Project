# WORDLY
## HOW TO PLAY

Guess the 5-letter word in 6 tries. The word should be a singular noun.
Letters can be repeated in the word.
The color of the tiles changes after every guess.

## COLOR CODES
- If the letter is in the word and in the right spot, it turns green üü©
- If the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, it turns yellow üü®
- If the letter is not in the word, it turns white ‚¨ú
